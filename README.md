# Child Mortality Prediction in Honduras Using PyTorch

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting child mortality rates in Honduras using historical data provided by UNICEF. The goal is to build a machine learning model using PyTorch that can forecast future mortality rates based on past trends.

## Overview

The notebook processes the dataset, trains a regression model, and evaluates its performance. This project demonstrates a basic time series prediction workflow using deep learning tools.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Files Included

- `Github projects.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data processing, model training, and prediction
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
- `*.csv`: Dataset file (if applicable)

## Project Workflow

1. Load and preprocess the child mortality data for Honduras
2. Visualize historical trends
3. Train a PyTorch-based regression model
4. Predict child mortality for upcoming years
5. Plot predictions and evaluate performance

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install torch pandas matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the notebook to process the data, train the model, and generate predictions

## Notes

- The model is trained specifically on Honduras data
- Can be expanded to cover other countries or time series indicators
- Designed as a demonstration of time series modeling, not for policy or clinical decisions
